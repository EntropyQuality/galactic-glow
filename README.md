## Installation üíæ

1. Open the Extensions sidebar in VSCode. `View ‚Üí Extensions`.
2. Search for `Galactic Glow`, and install it.
3. After installation, select the theme by navigating to `File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Color Theme ‚Üí Galactic Glow`.

## Recommended Font: JetBrains Mono ‚úçÔ∏è

To elevate your coding experience with Galactic Glow, we recommend using the JetBrains Mono font. This font is designed specifically for developers, offering improved readability and a modern, clean aesthetic that complements the theme's character-inspired styles.

### How to Install JetBrains Mono

1. Download the latest version of JetBrains Mono from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/).
2. Unzip the downloaded archive.
3. Install the font on your system:
   - **Windows**: Right-click on the `.ttf` files and select "Install".
   - **macOS**: Double-click on the `.ttf` files and press "Install Font".
   - **Linux**: Place the `.ttf` files into `~/.local/share/fonts` (or `/usr/share/fonts` to install fonts system-wide) and run `fc-cache -f -v`.

### Setting JetBrains Mono in VSCode

After installing the font, set it as your editor's font in VSCode:

1. Open VSCode settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,` on macOS).
2. Search for `Font Family`.
3. Enter `JetBrains Mono` as the first choice in the font list.
4. Ensure `Editor: Font Ligatures` is enabled to enjoy the full visual experience.

Below are my personal settings:
   ```json
    "editor.fontSize": 16,
    "editor.fontFamily": "'JetBrains Mono', 'Courier New', monospace",
    "editor.fontWeight": "bold", 
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 16,
   ```


## Special Instructions for Linux Users üêß

For Linux users, to fully experience the Galactic Glow theme as intended, you may need to enable certain features manually due to differences in how themes interact with the VSCode UI on Linux.

### Enabling Custom Components

1. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and press `Enter`.
3. Add or modify the following settings:
   ```json
   "window.titleBarStyle": "custom"
   ```
4. Save the settings and restart VSCode.
